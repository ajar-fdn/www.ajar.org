<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6em;"> The <em style="color: green;">AJAr Foundation</em> is a non-profit human rights and civil liberties group operating from within the United States&mdash;without borders&mdash;to strengthen mainstream conditions of lucid security, seamless ("worry-free") privacy, and confident exercise of rights and freedoms of interest to the general public.
<br><br>This mission is pursued by means of active research and developments that complement efforts of many active counterparts online, and also which supplement legal efforts &amp; policy work by agents of public interest globally.<!-- Additionaly, we maintain secure networks/services open for anonymous use. -->

	<h2 id="efforts">Efforts</h2>
    <h3 id="activism">Activism</h3>
    <p>
      Endorsed work is done carefully in promotion and defense of human rights and civil liberties, particularly with respect to those infringements stemming from apparent weaknesses in the mainstream conditions of information security standards, common practices, and critical judgements online.
    </p>
    <h3 id="mission">Mission</h3>
    <p>
      The organization's broad mission is to make superior preventive measures against infringement on civil rights and liberties more accessible to—and in more common use by—the general public, notably unconstrained by the average person's concern about freedom, knowledge of particular threats, or explicit demand for enhanced security.
    </p>
    <h4 id="short-order">Short Order</h4>
    <p>
      This mission exists in partial opposition to the present reality of mainstream computer networking, wherein good measures are technically available in most cases, but only to a tech-savvy minority who care directly about privacy and know how to use those facilities.

To put it more simply, the goal is to enhance security and privacy for the average Internet user without requiring that he/she ask for it or care any bit at all about their privacy to begin with.
    </p>
    <h4 id="big-picture">Big Picture</h4>
    <p>
      A long-term goal is some considerable realization of the Internet as a global public service that is free (as in free speech), open to all, and liberated from the many issues of strategic and moral regulation, surveillance, and harmful misconduct which plague the Internet in its present condition. It is our mission to address those issues which now enable infringement on the rights and liberties of the public at large.

	<h2 id="network">Network</h2>
	<h3 id="membership">Membership</h3>
	<small>New users must be invited by an existing user&mdash;or staff&mdash;to join.  <a href="#contacts">Contact</a> for invitation/support.</small>
		<p>All services require a free <a href="https://www.ajar.org">@ajar.org</a> handle. No personal information is requested. No existing e-mail address is required. User privacy, personal/operational security, and general welfare are the absolute top priorities of our network.</p>
	<p>Anonymous access is fine, and certainly encouraged wherever it helps users maintain personal/operational security and/or exercise their right to privacy, but still requires authentication as a registered network member in good standing.  All services are accessible via <a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> hidden services, including the member control panel.</p>

<!--<p>Invitations are one-off tokens, and are notably <b>not</b> tied to issuing members; they are signed authorizations generated by network servers at time of request, and there is no need to keep track of who invited whom.</p>-->
<h3 id="transparency">Transparency</h3>
<small>Subpoena <b>AJAr Foundation</b> (PA, USA) at registered office. Informal demands ignored, shared.</small>
<p>
<em>Transparency reports</em> will be updated within one day of receipt/notice of government-issued requests or orders to produce documents about member access or use, all of which will be handled formally and denied on grounds that no such records/logs exist.
</p>
<h3 id="legal">Terms &amp; Policies</h3>
	<h4 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h4>
	<p>No records of network traffic, access, or use are recorded by the AJAr Foundation for any service hosted on/beneath the <em>ajar.org</em> domain, nor any other domain controlled by the AJAr Foundation for which the contrary is not explicitly indicated.</p>
<p>In addition to public transparency reports, all network members will immediately be notified of general requests, orders, and other pressures attempting to obtain any personal or sensitive network information of any nature by any means. Targeted members under formal government investigation will be alerted privately before a formal response is issued to the pressuring entity.</p>
<p>Any pressures from non-governing entities are ignored, but may nevertheless be included in public transparency reports at our discretion. Government orders from any jurisdiction will always be included in the transparency report, and any orders to produce documents for nonexistent data shall be formally dismissed as infeasible.</p>
